## Philosophy

Inspired by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

* **One Dependency:** There is just one build dependency. It uses  Elm Platform, Webpack, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

* **Zero Configuration:** There are no configuration files or command line options. Configuring both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

* **No Lock-In:** You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

# RESEARCH 


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/27/what-you-hate-about-waiting-in-line-isnt-the-wait-at-all/?utm_term=.bd5df971dc15

In those early days, engineers were focused solely on efficiency — how to serve as many customers as possible without cutting into a company's profits. It wasn't until 50 years later that researchers began to realize that there were subtler factors influencing people's experience of waiting in line, including ideas of fairness, mismanaged expectations, and the strange and inaccurate way that most people perceive both time and pain.

Altogether, some people spend a year or two of their lives waiting in line, estimates Richard Larson, a professor who studies queuing theory at MIT. This back-of-the envelope calculation includes less obvious types of queues, like driving in slower-than-normal traffic during a daily commute.*


And the way that businesses manage lines results in easily billions of dollars of gained and lost brand equity and consumer spending. A long and unpleasant wait can damage a customer's view of a brand, cause people to leave a line or not enter it in the first place (what researchers respectively call "reneging" and "balking"), or discourage them from coming back to the store entirely.

Even so, businesses can still do a lot to improve customer experiences. As numerous studies show, how people feel when they wait in line often matters a lot more than the duration of the wait.

Mirrors by the elevator, TV screens at the airport, magazines in the waiting room, little knick-knacks to peruse and buy in the supermarket checkout aisle and, of course, smartphones, all take people's minds off of their frustration about being imprisoned in a line.

That guarantee of fairness eliminates a lot of stress and anxiety.

There's the stress of choosing the shortest line, and then there's the possibility that, for unforeseen reasons, your line will grind to a halt. You can analyze the contents of people's carts all you want, but the person in front of you may still pull out an envelope stuffed with coupons or a giant bag of pennies.

The study concludes that the duration of the experience doesn't matter that much to people — what matters is the discomfort at the worst and final moments.

Oddly, our feelings about queuing in a line aren't just based on expectations; our perception of a line is often all about that final moment. If a line speeds up at the end, we remember the experience positively. If it slows down, we have a negative memory.





















This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
